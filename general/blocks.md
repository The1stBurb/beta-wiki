# Metadata
Many blocks make use of the 4-Bit Metadata values that they have access to.
Often times these are used for indicating their direction. Sometimes they're used for if they're activated, open or if they're a variety of a share base-block, such as the different wool colors or logs.

## Liquids
Liquids indicate their level with their metadata. Generally, the further away they are from a water source, the lower their level gets.

## Wood
All wood or tree-related blocks have related values and behaviors.

### Saplings
Saplings have 3 distinct values.

| Value | Color |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Oak |
| 1 | Spruce |
| 2 | Birch |

Value `3` also shows up as oak, but is unobtainable under normal circumstances.

The upper 2-bits are used to indicate the age of the sapling.

### Logs
Logs have 3 distinct values.

| Value | Color |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Oak |
| 1 | Spruce |
| 2 | Birch |

Any other value will appear as oak.

### Leaves
Leaves have 3/4 distinct values. Only oak is biome-colored.

| Value | Color |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Oak |
| 1 | Spruce |
| 2 | Birch |
| 4 | Oak (spruce colors) |

The values after this simply follow the same pattern.

## Wool
Wool exists in 16 distinct colors.

{: .note }
> The color swatches were estimated by dividing the colored wool textures with the white one, then averaging the resulting images. This gets us decently close to the original colors that were used before the wool texture was applied ontop.

## Pistons
Pistons and Sticky pistons use their metadata values to indicate both their direction and state.
The lower 3-Bits indicate the pistons direction, while the remaining bit indicates whether the piston is retracted `0` or extended `1`.

| Value | Direction |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Down |
| 1 | Up |
| 2 | East |
| 3 | West |
| 4 | North |
| 5 | South |
| 6 | All (Invalid) |
| 7 | All (Invalid) |

## Piston Head
The piston head uses it's metadata like the pistons, though with one difference. The last bit is used to indicate whether the piston head is normal `0` or sticky `1`.

| Value | Direction |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Down |
| 1 | Up |
| 2 | East |
| 3 | West |
| 4 | North |
| 5 | South |

Values 6 and 7 do not render.
